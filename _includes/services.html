The <a href="https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/01/28/introducing-champions-program/">Openscapes Champions program</a> mentors environmental scientists and empowers them and their labs with open data science tools and practices and helps grow the community of practice within the lab, department, and beyond. Our inaugural Champions cohort includes seven scientists leading inspiring research: <a href="https://medium.com/@openscapes/openscapes-champions-incorporate-open-practices-in-their-science-7eefa07b8573">read about their research and Openscapes progress</a>. </b></p>

                   <p class="large text-muted">In March 2019 we brought the Champions together for a mid-program Summit as a chance to meet in person, strengthen relationships, share lessons learned, problem solve, and ignite new collaborations. We were also joined by two special guests who provided invaluable insight and comradery. <a href="https://bahlailab.org/">Dr. Christie Bahlai</a> — an applied quantitative ecologist and professor at Kent State University and Mozilla Fellow (2015) — shared her insight on creating an open lab culture and championing open data science practices in ecology. And <a href="http://seankross.com/about/">Sean Kross</a> — a PhD student at UC San Diego studying Human-Computer Interaction — shared insight on open software and data science instruction, including coding up some software for Champions on the fly. The Summit exceeded our (high!) expectations and we have started sharing reflections from the event in blog posts: the first is <a href="https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/04/08/summit-reflections1/">Openscapes summit reflections — becoming champions</a></p>.
