  text: One of the main missions of my work is to make scientific research and data more open and transparent. I do this by <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/"> establishing best practices </a>, data standards, and <a href = "https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/organization-RR-Jupyter/">creating education materials</a>.
